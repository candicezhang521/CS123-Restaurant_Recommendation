# Restaurant Recommendation Project | Logistic Flow

> Please patiently follow the steps below to make sure you successfully run all the scripts. Please free to contact Y-Cube for any suggestions.

## 1. Data Download

Please download raw dataset from [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). The dataset is also available on the private [Google Drive]().

A cleaned small subset of the dataset _test_data.csv_ including 500 users is available in the <code>Data</code> section as test dataset and you are welcome to download it and thus skip the Data Cleaning Step.

## 2. Data Cleaning

**(1) _json_to_csv.py_:** This python script converts all the json files downloaded from Yelp to csv format files.
* Input: yelp_academic_reviews.json
* Output: yelp_academic_reviews.csv
```sh
python3 json_to_csv.py yelp_academic_reviews.json
```

**(2) _-.py_:** This python script deals with filtering and standardization of the dataset. It cleans the dataset left with variables of interest, including text_reviews, user_id, business_id, and replaces all punctuations in text_reivews with space for further convenience.
* Input: yelp_academic_reviews.csv
* Output: filtered_reviews.csv
```sh
python3 
```

**(3) _-text_filtering.py_:** This python script filtered out the stop words from the text_reviews, for convience of calculating the similarity between users without the influnce of literacy level.
* Input: filtered_reviews.csv
* Output: reviews_nostopwords.csv
```sh
python3
```

## 3. Data Storage

**_database_construction.sql_:** This sql srcipt helps store the dataset in a sqlite3 database. It generates two sqlite3 tables and two csv files.
* Input: filtered_reviews.csv / test_data.csv 
* Output: yelp_test.db with table yelp_reviews and table user
	  user_reviews.csv
	  user_pairs.csv
```sh
sqlite3 yelp_test.db < database_construction.sql
```

## 4. User Data Vectorizaion - Find the most similar pair of users

**(1) _find_base_vector.py_:** This python script includes an MRJob that finds all the single word occured in all the reviews.
* Input: filtered_reviews.csv / test_data.csv
* Output: base_vector.txt
```sh
python3 find_base_vector.py test_data.csv > base_vector.txt
```

**(2) _user_reviews_filtering.py_:** This python script filters out the comma in user reviews appeared because of the sqlite3 GROUP_CONCAT command.
* Input: user_reviews.csv
* Output: user_reviews_nocommas.csv
```sh
python3 user_reviews_filtering.py
```

**(3) _find_vectors.py_:** This python script includes an MRJob that finds all the words occured in every single user's all reviews and create a vector based on the base vector with weights as frequency of occurence of every single word.
* Input: user_reviews_nocommas.csv
* Output: user_vectors.txt
```sh
python3 find_vectors.py user_reviews_nocommas.csv > user_vectors.txt
```

**(4) _user_vector_construction.sql_:** This sqlite3 script imports the vector of users into a table.
* Input: user_vectors.txt
* Output: table user_vector in yelp_test.db
```sh
sqlite3 yelp_test.db < user_vector_construction.sql
```

**(5) _find_similar_users.py_:** This python script includes an MRJob that compute the cosi similarity between each pair of users and finds the most similar one for each user.
* Input: user_pairs.csv
	 table user_vector in yelp_test.db
* Output: similar_users.txt
```sh
python3 find_similar_users.py user_pairs.csv > similar_users.txt
```

## 5. Restaurant Data Vectorizaion - Find the recommendations for users

**(1) _restaurant_info.sql_:** This sqlite3 script concatenates all reviews about every restaurant and imports the restaurant infomation. It generates one csv file and a sqlite3 table.
* Input: restaurant_info.sql
* Output: restaurant_reviews.csv
	  table restaurant_info in yelp_test.db
```sh
sqlite3 yelp_test.db < restaurant_info.sql
```

**(2) _restaurant_reviews_filtering.py_:** This python script filters out the comma in restaurant reviews appeared because of the sqlite3 GROUP_CONCAT command.
* Input: restaurant_reviews.csv
* Output: restaurant_reviews_nocommas.csv
```sh
python3 restaurant_reviews_filtering.py
```

**(3) _restaurant_pairs.py_:** This python script finds all the pairs of restaurants that the most similar user pairs have respectively visited.
* Input: similar_users.txt
	 table yelp_reviews in yelp_test.db
* Output: restaurant_pairs.csv
```sh
python3 restaurant_pairs.py
```

**(4) _find_vectors.py_:** This is the same python script used in 4(3). It includes an MRJob that finds all the words occured in every single restaurant's all reviews and create a vector based on the base vector with weights as frequency of occurence of every single word.
* Input: restaurant_reviews_nocommas.csv
* Output: restaurant_vectors.txt
```sh
python3 find_vectors.py restaurant_reviews_nocommas.csv > restaurant_vectors.txt
```

**(5) _restaurant_vector_construction.sql_:** This sqlite3 script imports the vector of restaurants into a table.
* Input: restaurant_vectors.txt
* Output: table restaurant_vector in yelp_test.db
```sh
sqlite3 yelp_test.db < restaurant_vector_construction.sql
```

**(6) _find_similar_restaurants.py_:** This python script includes an MRJob that computes the cosi similarity between each pair of restaurants and finds the pairs with higher cosi similarity than (1 - cosi similarity of the pair of users).
* Input: restaurant_pairs.csv
	table restaurant_vector in yelp_test.db
* Output: similar_restaurants.txt
```sh
python3 find_similar_restaurants.py restaurant_pairs.csv > similar_restaurants.txt
```

**(7) _analysis.py_:** This python script conducts the success rate of the recommendation system of this project.
* Input: similar_restaurants.txt
* Output: recommendation_results.csv
```sh
python3 analysis.py
```
