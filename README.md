# Restaurant Recommendation Project

UChicago | CMSC 12300/CAPP 30123 | Spring 2017

## Introduction:
With more and more access and ease in using the Internet, an increasing number of people are writing reviews for their experiences (Hu, Liu, 2004). As a result, the number of reviews that a product receives grows rapidly over the recent years, providing cascades of complex information. As humans are innately pleased by good food and unique dining experiences, Yelp nowadays became the most popular online consumer review website used for local business reviews and recommendations (Bird, 2015). The abundance of Yelp reviews provides sufficient starting point for doing text analysis. Building on past users’ review, in this project, we will take on a creative approach to do restaurant recommendation to users, by performing a detailed text analysis of users’ reviews on Yelp.
