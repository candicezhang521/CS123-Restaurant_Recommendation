This year, Yelp presents the ninth round of its own dataset challenge. Yelp released a dataset that includes information about local businesses in 11 cities across four countries. All data were enclosed in five json files. For our own convenience, we converted all the json files to csv format files. In our project, we used two sub datasets that contains text reviews for restaurants and information about businesses.
